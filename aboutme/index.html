  <p>My name is Gabriela. I'm 24 years old and I from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I have been married for almost 2 years with my best friend Michelangelo (not the artist, nor the turtle). You could say that we are a technology couple, because we are both studying Applied Technology at BYU. I want to become a great Full-Stack Developer.
    <br> I served mission in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, here in Brazil, from 2019 to 2021. This taught me how to get closer to the Savior and how to achieve the power of the Atonement in my life.
    <br> And I love to play volleyball, watch mystery series, and read books.
